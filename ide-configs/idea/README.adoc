= Configuration Files for Idea IDE

If you have an existing hawkular Scheme and you want to be 100% sure the new one will be imported and overrides all the existing settings, just use

```bash
rm ~/.IntelliJIdea*/config/codestyles/*
```

To obtain the `settings.jar`, run 

```bash
mvn clean install
```

You'll find the `settings.jar` in the `target` directory.
